#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.Jansales
WHERE product = "iPhone"
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct customers.acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.OrderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY Price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*Price AS Total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT location, Product, quantity, Sum(quantity)*price AS Total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
Where location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
Group BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price) AS Avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales As feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers As cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM (quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.Febsales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product';
