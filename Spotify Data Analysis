# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the who the top 10 artists are based on popularity

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY Popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#Then I determined which artist has the song with the highest danceability

SELECT artist_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 1;

#Then I found the average duration for the 10 most popular songs

SELECT track_name, popularity, AVG(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#Then I determined the avg tempo by artist and track

SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(tempo)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Then I determined which artist has the highest tempo for a song

SELECT artist_name,track_name,tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY tempo desc
LIMIT 1;

#Then I determine how many songs in the database have Olivia Rodrigo listed as the artist

SELECT distinct artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name like '%olivia rodrigo%'
